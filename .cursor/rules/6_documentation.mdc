### Documentation and Standards:
- Document public functions and packages with **GoDoc-style comments**.
- Provide concise **READMEs** for services and libraries.
- Maintain a 'CONTRIBUTING.md' and 'ARCHITECTURE.md' to guide team practices.
- Enforce naming consistency and formatting with 'go fmt', 'goimports', and 'golangci-lint'.
- Add the relevant comments when needed to build OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
