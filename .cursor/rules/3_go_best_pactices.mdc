### Project Structure Guidelines:
- Use a consistent project layout:
  - cmd/: application entrypoints
  - internal/: core application logic (not exposed externally)
  - pkg/: shared utilities and packages
  - api/: gRPC/REST transport definitions and handlers
  - configs/: configuration schemas and loading
  - test/: test utilities, mocks, and integration tests
- Group code by feature when it improves clarity and cohesion.
- Keep logic decoupled from framework-specific code.

### Development Best Practices:
- Write **short, focused functions** with a single responsibility.
- Always **check and handle errors explicitly**, using wrapped errors for traceability ('fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)').
- Avoid **global state**; use constructor functions to inject dependencies.
- Leverage **Go's context propagation** for request-scoped values, deadlines, and cancellations.
- Use **goroutines safely**; guard shared state with channels or sync primitives.
- **Defer closing resources** and handle them carefully to avoid leaks.

### Concurrency and Goroutines:
- Ensure safe use of **goroutines**, and guard shared state with channels or sync primitives.
- Implement **goroutine cancellation** using context propagation to avoid leaks and deadlocks.

### Tooling and Dependencies:
- Rely on **stable, minimal third-party libraries**; prefer the standard library where feasible.
- Use **Go modules** for dependency management and reproducibility.
- Version-lock dependencies for deterministic builds.
- Integrate **linting, testing, and security checks** in CI pipelines.

### Libraries
- Use testify in unit tests: github.com/stretchr/testify
- Use cobra for entrypoints: github.com/spf13/cobra
- Use zerolog for logging: github.com/rs/zerolog
- Use go uuid: github.com/google/uuid
