### Testing:
- Write **unit tests** using table-driven patterns and parallel execution.
- **Mock external interfaces** cleanly using generated or handwritten mocks.
- Separate **fast unit tests** from slower integration and E2E tests.
- Ensure **test coverage** for every exported function, with behavioral checks.
- Use tools like 'go test -cover' to ensure adequate test coverage.
