### Workflow
- Create a new branch for each new requests
- Commit the code changes in small and consistent chunks that make sense together following the convential commit guidelines (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Ensure github action workflow pass locally before pushing the code to github
- Push the branch to github and create a Github pull request with the relevant context, goal, tradeoffs, breaking changes and outcomes so the reviewer understand the intent of the changes
