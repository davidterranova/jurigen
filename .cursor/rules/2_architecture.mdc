### Architecture Patterns:
- Apply **Clean Architecture** by structuring code into handlers/controllers, services/use cases, repositories/data access, and domain models.
- Use **domain-driven design** principles where applicable.
- Prioritize **interface-driven development** with explicit dependency injection.
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**; favor small, purpose-specific interfaces.
- Ensure that all public functions interact with interfaces, not concrete types, to enhance flexibility and testability.
